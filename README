How to install

In order to use run, you'll need the following perl packages:

Proc::ProcessTable;
Parse::RecDescent;
Digest::MD5;

If you are the system administrator, you can install the corresponding distribution package.  
On debian or ubuntu this can be done with:

sudo apt-get install libparse-recdescent-perl libproc-processtable-perl 

You can also install the cpan packages using the cpan shell:

$> cpan

If it's the first time you run it, it'll ask few question, it's usually ok to provide default answers.
This will add some configuration into your personal shell config file, do not forget to source it if necessary. Then re-run the cpan shell
e.g.:
$> source .bashrc
$> cpan

cpan> install Parse::RecDescent 
cpan> install Proc::ProcessTable
