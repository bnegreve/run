runtime version 0.01
====================

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

Proc::ProcessTable
Parse::RecDescent
Digest::MD5



If you are the system administrator, you can install the corresponding distribution package.  
On debian or ubuntu this can be done with:

sudo apt-get install libparse-recdescent-perl libproc-processtable-perl 

You can also install the cpan packages using the cpan shell:

$> cpan

(If it's the first time you run it, it'll ask few question, it's usually ok to provide default answers.)

cpan> install Parse::RecDescent 
cpan> install Proc::ProcessTable
cpan> install Digest::MD5



INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install 

Note that you will probably need to run the last command with system administrator privileges since the default installation path is /usr. 
Run the commmand as root or using sudo. 

If you are not system administrator, you can install Runtime in your home directory like this:

   perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=<prefixpath>
   make
   make test
   make install 

Where <prefixpath> is any directory with writing permissions, for example /home/ben/local/

Note that you will also need to add the <prefixpath>/lib in your Perl library path, 
and the <prefixpath>/bin/ dir in your path. 

For example, using bash
    export PERL5LIB=<prefixpath>/lib:$PERL5LIB
    export PATH=<prefixpath>/bin:$PATH

(Don't forget to replace <prefixpath> by the actual prefix path.)
