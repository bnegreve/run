runtime version 0.01
====================

The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
that should be provided before the module is installed.

A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the
README file from a module distribution so that people browsing the
archive can use it get an idea of the modules uses. It is usually a
good idea to provide version information here so that people can
decide whether fixes for the module are worth downloading.

How to install

In order to use run, you'll need the following perl packages:

Proc::ProcessTable;
Parse::RecDescent;
Digest::MD5;

If you are the system administrator, you can install the corresponding distribution package.  
On debian or ubuntu this can be done with:

sudo apt-get install libparse-recdescent-perl libproc-processtable-perl 

You can also install the cpan packages using the cpan shell:

$> cpan

(If it's the first time you run it, it'll ask few question, it's usually ok to provide default answers.)

cpan> install Parse::RecDescent 
cpan> install Proc::ProcessTable
