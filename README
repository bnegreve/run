How to install

In order to use run, you'll need the following perl packages:

Proc::ProcessTable;
Parse::RecDescent;
Digest::MD5;

If you are the system administrator, you can install the corresponding distribution package.  
On debian or ubuntu this can be done with:

sudo apt-get install libparse-recdescent-perl libproc-processtable-perl 

You can also install the cpan packages using the cpan shell:

$> cpan

(If it's the first time you run it, it'll ask few question, it's usually ok to provide default answers.)

cpan> install Parse::RecDescent 
cpan> install Proc::ProcessTable
